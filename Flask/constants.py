diesease_treatment = {'Bacterial_spot':'Prevention & Treatment: Only use certified disease-free seeds and plants. Avoid areas that were planted with peppers or tomatoes during the previous year. Avoid overhead watering by using drip or furrow irrigation. Remove and dispose of all diseased plant material. Prune plants to promote air circulation. Spraying with a copper fungicide will give fairly good control of the bacterial disease.',
				              'Early_blight':'Prevention & Treatment: Use resistant or tolerant tomato cultivars. Use pathogen-free seed and do not set diseased plants in the field. Use crop rotation, eradicate weeds and volunteer tomato plants, space plants to not touch, mulch plants, fertilize properly, donâ€™t wet tomato foliage with irrigation water, and keep the plants growing vigorously. Trim off and dispose of infected lower branches and leaves.',
				              'healthy': 'This is healthy Leaf', 
                      'Late_blight':'Prevention & Treatment: Keep foliage dry. Locate your garden where it will receive morning sun.Allow extra room between the plants, and avoid overhead watering, especially late in the day.Purchase certified disease-free seeds and plants.Destroy volunteer tomato and potato plants, as well as nightshade family weeds, such as Carolina horsenettle or black nightshade, which may harbor the fungus.Do not compost rotten, store-bought potatoes.Pull out and destroy diseased plants.',
                      'Leaf_Mold':'Prevention & Treatment: Crop residue should be removed from the field. Staking and pruning to increase air circulation helps to control the disease. Space tomato plants further apart for better air circulation between plants. Avoid wetting leaves when watering. Rotate with vegetables other than tomatoes. Using a preventative fungicide program with chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper fungicide, can control the disease. See Table 1 for fungicide products for home garden use.',
                      'Septoria_leaf_spot':'Prevention & Treatment: Most currently grown tomato cultivars are susceptible to Septoria leaf spot. Crop rotation of 3 years and sanitation (removal of crop debris) will reduce the amount of inoculum. Do not use overhead irrigation. Repeated fungicide applications with chlorothalonil (very good) or copper fungicide, or mancozeb (good) will keep the disease in check. See Table 1 for examples of fungicide products for home garden use.',
                      'Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite':'Prevention & Treatment:Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops.Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.Do not over-fertilize.Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.',
           		        'Target_Spot':'Prevention & Treatment: Ensure all seed you may sow are disease free. Avoid collecting seed from mature plants showing this disease. If target spot becomes a major concern, remove all plants and burn or bin - do not compost!  Allow soil to be fallow for at least one season before attempting to replant.Practice regular crop rotation methods so problems do not re-occur and reinfect young plants.', 
           		        'Tomato_mosaic_virus':"Prevention & Treatment:There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected. Do NOT save seed from infected crops. ", 
           		        'Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus':'Prevention & Treatment:symptomatic plants should be carefully covered by a clear or black plastic bag and tied at the stem at soil line. Cut off the plant below the bag and allow bag with plant and whiteflies to desiccate to death on the soil surface for 1-2 days prior to placing the plant in the trash. Do not cut the plant off or pull it out of the garden and toss it on the compost! The goal is to remove the plant reservoir of virus from the garden and to trap the existing virus-bearing whiteflies so they do not disperse onto other tomatoes.'
